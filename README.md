# YuruBound
A poopy EarthBound romhack.

# What Do I Do With These Files?
Just to be safe, there aren't any EarthBound assets in this repository - it's just new things. Consequently, you will need to download [CoilSnake](https://mrtenda.github.io/CoilSnake/index.html) to decompile an EarthBound ROM to get everything that's missing. You can then replace the files and compile a new ROM.

# How Can I Help?
Truthfully, I don't really know how to use github, but I think you can submit a pull request to add any changes you've made. Be it a new sprite, some new dialogue, or a whole epic at the library. 
That said, if you are going to add new text, please append any flags used to Flags_in_use.txt.
