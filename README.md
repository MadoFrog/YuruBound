# YuruBound
A poopy EarthBound romhack.

# What Do I Do With These Files?
Just to be safe, there aren't any EarthBound assets in this repository - it's just new things. Consequently, you will need to download [CoilSnake](https://github.com/mrtenda/CoilSnake/releases) to decompile an EarthBound ROM to get everything that's missing. You can then replace the files and compile a new ROM. 
Please use CoilSnake 3.0 **not** 3.33, as 3.33 has an issue with the altered sprite palettes.

# What If I Want To Play A Certain Version?
Just head over to [Releases](https://github.com/MadoFrog/YuruBound/releases) and download the IPS patch for the version you want. You'll need a clean ROM of EarthBound and a program to apply the patch - [CoilSnake](https://github.com/mrtenda/CoilSnake/releases) is one that will let you do that. 

# How Can I Help?
Truthfully, I don't really know how to use github, but I think you can submit a pull request to add any changes you've made. Be it a new sprite, some new dialogue, or a whole epic at the library. 
That said, if you are going to add new text, please append any flags used to Flags_in_use.txt.
